## Disclaimers

-   No hate were intended towards any of the members of VRCMG or LavaGang in the development of this mod. The naming is just something I thought was funny and I have absolutely no hard feelings towards those awesome communities.

-   This is the first mod I made, as well as the first thing I programmed in C#. It was never meant for public release and was just something i made for fun, thus the code probably isn't the most readable or the most optimized.

## About

This mod was created for my own personal use only and allowed to unlock risky functions globally on select mods from the VRCMG as well as use emmVRCs favorites without VRC+, by patching the mods on runtime.

As some mods (e.g. emmVRC) implemented the PatchShield (aka HarmonyShield) attribute from MelonLoader, a safety to prevent patches from being applied to specific classes, a patch bypassing this security feature was implemented.
